[Tableau Visualization](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ankit.aggarwal7213/viz/BoardGameAnalysis_17090868377830/BoardGameAnalysis?publish=yes)

Goal: Identify the key factors influencing board game ratings to enhance user engagement and increase sales.

Summary: This project encompassed a comprehensive analysis of 20,000+ board games, aiming to pinpoint the factors contributing to positive user ratings and lower BGG rankings. It involved extensive data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and the application of machine learning models. 

Skills and Technologies: Python (Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn), Data Visualization, Data Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, Correlation Matrices, Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVM (Support Vector Machine), KNN (K Nearest Neighbors)

Results: The findings highlighted several determinants of high user ratings, including complexity, minimum age, minimum player count, specific mechanics (dice rolling, hand management, auctions), and the game's domain (strategy, war, family). These insights offer valuable guidance for enhancing board game design and marketing strategies to boost ratings and sales.

### [Analysis and Classification of Myers-Briggs Personality Type](/PersonalityClassification.ipynb)

Goal: Classify Myers-Briggs personality types based on responses to a set of questions to provide insights into individual traits and behavior patterns.

Summary: This project undertook a comprehensive analysis of 60,000+ responses, aiming to classify individuals into one of 16 Myers-Briggs personality types. It involved extensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the application of machine learning models to achieve accurate classification.

Skills and Technologies: Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn), Data Visualization, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Correlation Matrices, Linear Regression, Random Forest

Results: The random forest model demonstrated remarkable accuracy, correctly predicting personality types 98% of the time based on responses to the questions. These findings provide valuable insights into personality traits and offer potential applications in personal development, team building, and career counseling.

### [Analysis of Covid-19 in India](/Covid_India.ipynb)

[Tableau Visualization](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ankit.aggarwal7213/viz/Covid-19inIndia_17086550939330/Covid-19Dashboard?publish=yes)

Goal: Determine geographical and monthly Covid-19 trends in India and forecast safety in the 100 days beyond May 2021.

Summary: This project involved analyzing a dataset of worldwide Covid-19 confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths, narrowing it down to India and Delhi. It included data cleaning, exploratory data analysis on monthly and geographical trends, and forecasting future data from July 2020 to 100 days past May 2021.

Skills and Technologies: Python (Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Prophet), Data Visualization, Data Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, Forecasting

Results: The analysis revealed an upward trend in Covid-19 cases, forecasting safety considerations for the 100 days beyond May 2021. However, limitations were acknowledged, including the absence of factors like vaccination status and herd immunity in the analysis.


### [Analysis of Netflix Movies and TV Shows](/Netflix_SQL.md)

Goal: To analyze various aspects of Netflix's TV and movie listings as of July 2022.

Summary: This project involves examining a dataset containing over 5000 Netflix listings, focusing on key factors such as genres, popular actors and directors, production countries, and more.

Skills and Technologies: SQL (joins, common table expressions, subqueries), MySQL.

Results: The analysis provides insights into the factors influencing the success of Netflix productions. These insights inform a hypothetical recommendation regarding the production of an original Netflix series.

### [HR Analytics](/HR_Analytics_SQL.md)

Goal: To conduct comprehensive analysis on an HR dataset comprising employee information.

Summary: This project entails exploring various facets of the HR dataset, including employee demographics, performance metrics, termination reasons, managerial effectiveness, recruitment sources, and more.

Skills and Technologies: SQL (joins, common table expressions, subqueries, window functions), MySQL.

Results: The analysis offers valuable insights into employee dynamics and organizational trends, aiding in decision-making processes related to performance improvement, talent management, and recruitment strategies. These insights may inform HR policies and practices aimed at enhancing employee satisfaction, productivity, and retention.
