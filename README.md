## Portfolio Projects

### [Analysis of Board Game Ratings](/BoardGameSales.ipynb)

[Tableau Visualization](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ankit.aggarwal7213/viz/BoardGameAnalysis_17090868377830/BoardGameAnalysis?publish=yes)

Goal: Identify the key factors influencing board game ratings to enhance user engagement and increase sales.

Summary: This project encompassed a comprehensive analysis of 20,000+ board games, aiming to pinpoint the factors contributing to positive user ratings and lower BGG rankings. It involved extensive data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and the application of machine learning models. 

Skills and Technologies: Python (Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, scikit-learn), Data Visualization, Data Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, Correlation Matrices, Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVM (Support Vector Machine), KNN (K Nearest Neighbors)

Results: The findings highlighted several determinants of high user ratings, including complexity, minimum age, minimum player count, specific mechanics (dice rolling, hand management, auctions), and the game's domain (strategy, war, family). These insights offer valuable guidance for enhancing board game design and marketing strategies to boost ratings and sales.


### [Analysis of Covid-19 in India](/Covid_India.ipynb)

[Tableau Visualization](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ankit.aggarwal7213/viz/Covid-19inIndia_17086550939330/Covid-19Dashboard?publish=yes)

Goal: Determine geographical and monthly Covid-19 trends in India and forecast safety in the 100 days beyond May 2021.

Summary: This project involved analyzing a dataset of worldwide Covid-19 confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths, narrowing it down to India and Delhi. It included data cleaning, exploratory data analysis on monthly and geographical trends, and forecasting future data from July 2020 to 100 days past May 2021.

Skills and Technologies: Python (Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Prophet), Data Visualization, Data Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, Forecasting

Results: The analysis revealed an upward trend in Covid-19 cases, forecasting safety considerations for the 100 days beyond May 2021. However, limitations were acknowledged, including the absence of factors like vaccination status and herd immunity in the analysis.
